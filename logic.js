//LOGIC PLAN
//#region 
/*

when generating the game, add classes to the grid squares that say what's in them
the last class in the classList array will be the type of room that grid square is

LOGIC FOR ROOM GENERATION
variables that store the number of x item that has to be in the game
let neededOre=3
let neededFluff=3
let neededDragons=2
etc.
do a foreach through an array containing each grid square
check what's needed, add it to x room, fill empty ones with rats or whatever.
let BOSSES = [] (possible boss rooms to randomize through and add)
let RESOURCES = [] (possible resource rooms to randomize through and add)
let RATS = [] (rat rooms)
let SCORPIONS = [] (you get the idea)

LOGIC FOR FINDING WHAT ACTIONS TO DO IN A ROOM
let roomType = room.classList[room.classList.length-1];
--> returns 'fish' or 'dragon' or 'miningAndFluff' etc.
